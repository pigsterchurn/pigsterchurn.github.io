## A little more about myself...

- An ordinary individual who has a regular full-time job (not as a gamer/streamer)
- Been playing video games since the PS1 era and is probably one of my very few hobbies
- Prefers playing rhythm games and casual games

## Why rhythm games?
- Earliest brush with rhythm games was Guitar Hero III (yes I had the plastic guitar)
- Getting a sense of satisfaction when being able to beat hard songs
- Due to being busy with real life, rhythm games is perfect for quick, short bursts
- Can basically play them forever because beating high scores is an eternal journey

## But you don't even play on the highest difficulty...
- Simply because I don't have the skills to do so :cry:

## Why this website?
- I started this website on 19th Jun 2020 as a random side coding project
- Motivation was to keep track of my Project Diva: Mega Mix high scores with recordings
- From there, I began recording other video games as well
