Tap/hold/drag on the notes when the line (which also moves up and down) touches them.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Likes\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the small price tag, it comes with a decent number of nice songs. Game is also being updated quite regularly even though it has been released for a few years.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src={useBaseUrl(\'/blog_img/cytus2-2.jpg\')} />\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike most rhythm games, there\'s an element of storytelling in an unique form of social media posts. New posts are unlocked whenever you level up a character.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeveling is quite fast - it usually takes me around 1-2 songs per level on Hard difficulty. Recently they even added an \\"experience share\\" kind of thing where other characters also gain levels at a slightly lesser amount. Really helps with the grind!\\r\\n\\r\\n## Dislikes\\r\\n\\r\\nGrinding levels can still be kind of tiring after a while, even with the better quality of life additions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause of how the notes appear, sometimes it\'s very easy to miss notes because your hands were blocking them.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoesn\'t seem to have cross save transfer between Android and iOS, so I\'m stuck on playing only on iOS as I don\'t want to restart from scratch on Android (yes I have it on Android too when it was free for a limited time).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Additional thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared to the first Cytus game, I prefer this due to the nicer graphics and the character stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s also DLCs in the form of more characters (i.e. more songs), but each pack is like $15. I actually bought the Miku character as a diehard Vocaloid fan, but not sure if she contributes to the storyline at all."},{"id":"Groove Coaster Wai Wai Party","metadata":{"permalink":"/v2/blog/2021/10/24/groove-coaster","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-24-groove-coaster.md","title":"Groove Coaster Wai Wai Party","description":"Details","date":"2021-10-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 24, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":2.075,"truncated":true,"authors":[],"prevItem":{"title":"Cytus II","permalink":"/v2/blog/2021/10/25/cytus-ii"},"nextItem":{"title":"About this section","permalink":"/v2/blog/2021/10/23/about-this-section"}},"content":"import useBaseUrl from \'@docusaurus/useBaseUrl\';\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src={useBaseUrl(\'/blog_img/groove-coaster.jpg\')} />\\r\\n\\r\\n## Details\\r\\n- Platform: Nintendo Switch\\r\\n- Purchased: 21th Oct 2021\\r\\n- Price: 55.99 CAD (after 30% discount from U.P.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Gameplay\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src={useBaseUrl(\'/blog_img/groove-coaster-2.jpg\')} />\\r\\n\\r\\nNotes are found on the \\"rails\\", and the avatar basically zooms on these rails. You need to input the buttons when the avatar reaches the notes, and there\'s different types of inputs.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Likes\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this is the first rhythm game where I feel that even Easy is quite challenging. Also, I only bought this because of the Vocaloid songs on it. Very happy that there are also songs by Gumi and IA on it, which are usually not included in the Project Diva games sadly.\\r\\n\\r\\n<img src={useBaseUrl(\'/blog_img/groove-coaster-1.jpg\')} />\\r\\n\\r\\nSome may not like this, but I like the mission thing as it gives a sense of progression. The song comes with 100 songs (which is a lot actually), but 29 have to be unlocked through these missions, alongside other things like navigators and avatars.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s local multiplayer too, but I\'m mainly playing this by myself anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Dislikes\\r\\n\\r\\nNo online multiplayer, although it\'s not like I have friends to play this with.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I find that whenever I start up the game, only the first loading time feels very long. Quite not used to it as other Switch games don\'t have this issue, but it\'s just a minor gripe.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a big fan of the \\"ad-lib\\" notes, which are basically invisible notes. You have to guess where they are based on the music, so it\'s hard to get 100%. At least they are optional.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe background that shows when a song is playing may have too many animations at times, which can be distracting and makes the notes hard to see.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Additional thoughts\\r\\n\\r\\nActually I first encountered this game in a local arcade a long time ago. Unfortunately, I can no longer find it so at least I can play this whenever I want to now.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, I find it quite enjoyable and would definitely be playing this for weeks. Unfortunately, the price is really steep. I wasn\'t willing to buy until the sale and even with the discount, it still feels quite pricey. Not to mention that additional DLC song packs are over $20 after converting to my local currency...\\r\\n\\r\\nThe game is also on Steam for a much lower price, but I think there\'s significantly lesser songs. Plus, I wanted to buy on the Switch for portability reasons."},{"id":"About this section","metadata":{"permalink":"/v2/blog/2021/10/23/about-this-section","source":"@site/blog/2021-10-23-about-this-section.md","title":"About this section","description":"Introduction","date":"2021-10-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 23, 2021","tags":[],"readingTime":0.415,"truncated":false,"authors":[],"prevItem":{"title":"Groove Coaster Wai Wai Party","permalink":"/v2/blog/2021/10/24/groove-coaster"}},"content":"## Introduction\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided to try jotting down some quick reviews on my game experiences.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What about Tumblr?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is mainly for reviewing games and peripherals, while Tumblr is more for random rantings and other topics that do not fit here.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Disclaimers\\r\\n\\r\\n- Don\'t expect professional reviews here - you can easily find those elsewhere\\r\\n- This is more of my personal opinions on my game experiences\\r\\n- They are meant to be bite-sized (a few minutes of reading time each)"}]}')}}]);
