## Gameplay

Notes appear in an up/down kind of motion. Tap/hold/drag on the notes when the line (which also moves up and down) touches them.

## Likes

For the small price tag, it comes with a decent number of nice songs. Game is also being updated quite regularly even though it has been released for a few years.

Unlike most rhythm games, there's an element of storytelling in an unique form of social media posts. New posts are unlocked whenever you level up a character.

Leveling is quite fast - it usually takes me around 1-2 songs per level on Hard difficulty. Recently they even added an "experience share" kind of thing where other characters also gain levels at a slightly lesser amount. Really helps with the grind!

## Dislikes

Grinding levels can still be kind of tiring after a while, even with the better quality of life additions.

Because of how the notes appear, sometimes it's very easy to miss notes because your hands were blocking them.

Doesn't seem to have cross save transfer between Android and iOS, so I'm stuck on playing only on iOS as I don't want to restart from scratch on Android (yes I have it on Android too when it was free for a limited time).

## Additional thoughts

Compared to the first Cytus game, I prefer this due to the nicer graphics and the character stuff.

There's also DLCs in the form of more characters (i.e. more songs), but each pack is like $15. I actually bought the Miku character as a diehard Vocaloid fan, but not sure if she contributes to the storyline at all.
